# Web-Tac-Toe

[My Notes](notes.md)

Have you ever wanted to play a game with a friend, but only had a few minutes to do so? Web-Tac-Toe is your solution! Web-Tac-Toe is a tic-tac-toe application that allows for quick games of tic-tac-toe between friends. Join a room with a friend and either play one quick game, or string several games back to back. The room will keep track of how many wins each player has so players can have proof of who is truly the tic-tac-toe master.

>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

### Elevator pitch

Have you ever wanted to play a game with a friend, but only had a few minutes to do so? Web-Tac-Toe is your solution! Web-Tac-Toe is a tic-tac-toe application that allows for quick games of tic-tac-toe between friends. Join a room with a friend and either play one quick game, or string several games back to back. The room will keep track of how many wins each player has so players can have proof of who is truly the tic-tac-toe master.

### Design

![Design image](DesignImage.png)

Three HTML pages. One for login/register, one for home/viewing rooms, and one for playing game inside a room. Users will be able to create and join rooms. Inside these rooms they will be able to play tic-tac-toe by making moves. They will also be able to randomize their own color on both the homepage and inside of a room. The win/loss record of the room will be shown in both the homepage list of rooms and the room itself.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Uses correct HTML structure for application. Three HTML pages. One for login/register, one for home/viewing rooms, and one for playing game inside a room.
- **CSS** - Application styling that looks good on different screen sizes, uses good whitespace, color choice and contrast. 
- **React** - Provides login, making moves, displaying win/loss record, backend endpoint calls, and use of React for routing and components.
- **Service** - Backend service endpoints for:
  - Register/Login/Logout users
  - Create/Join/Delete rooms
  - Making moves
  - Randomizing color (Third Party)
- **DB/Login** - Store users, rooms, and games in database. Register and login/logout users. Credentials securely stored in database. Can't make or join rooms, or make moves unless authenticated.
- **WebSocket** - As moves are made or colors are randomized, they are broadcast to all other users.
